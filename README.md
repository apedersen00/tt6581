# TT6581

Inspired by the legendary MOS6581 Sound Interface Device (SID) chip used in retro computers such as the Commodore 64, the _Tiny Tapeout_ 6581 (TT6581) is a completely digital interpretation supporting nearly the entire original MOS6581 feature set implemeted in 2x2 tiles for Tiny Tapeout.

As a demonstration here are two songs that *are produced by RTL testbenches*:

## Features

- Full control through a Serial-Peripheral Interface (SPI).
- Three independently synthesized voices.
- Four supported waveform types (triangle, sawtooth, square and noise).
- Attack, decay, sustain, release (ADSR) envelope shaping.
- Chamberlin State-Variable Filter (SVF) for low-pass, high-pass, band-pass and band-reject.
- Second-order Delta-Sigma DAC.

## Architecture

![TT6581 Architecture](media/tt6581_datapath.png)

Above the rough diagram shows the datapath in the TT6581. A tick generator enables the generation of a single audio sample.

1. *Voice Generation:* One 10-bit voice at a time is generated. Internal phase registers keep track of each voice's state while inactive. The frequency and waveform type is set by the programmed values in the register file.

2. *Envelope:* An envelope value from 255 (max) to 0 (min) is generated and applied to each voice one at a time by multiplication.

3. *Wave Accumulation:* The three voices are accumulated (mixed) by addition. Depending on the filter enable bit of each voice, they are accumulated in one of two registers: one that will be passed through the SVF, and one that will bypass it.

4. *Filter:*  The SVF is applied to the voices with filtering enabled. The filter is a Chamberlin State-Variable Filter and produce a low-pass, high-pass, band-pass or band-reject filter depending on configuration. Both cut-off frequency and resonance (Q) are tuneable. Running the filter on one sample requires three multiplications.

5. *Global Volume:* The SVF output is summed with the voices in the bypass accumulator. A global 8-bit volume is applied by multiplication. The result is the final mix.

6. *Delta-Sigma PDM:* A Error-Feedback Delta-Sigma modulator produces a 1-bit PDM output. The modulator runs at 10 MHz for an Oversampling-Rate (OSR) of 200.

## Building and Testing

The project contains two separate testbench environments:

1. C++ testbenches for Verilator
2. CocoTB testbenches

The C++ Verilator testbenches are significantly faster and was the main tool for verification during development. The CocoTB was implemented as a high-level verification that can also run on the synthesizes gate-level netlist.

### Verilator

Verilator testbenches are stored in `sim/`:

```
sim
├── cpp         # C++ testbenches
├── logs        # Waveform files
├── tmp         # Temporary data files from the TBs
├── out         # Testbench results
├── scripts     # Python script for parsin TB intermediate files in out/
├── stimulus    # Stimulus file for tt6581_player TB
├── tb          # SystemVerilog wrappers for the testbenches
└── Makefile    # Makefile for running the testbenches
```

To run a testbench, simply run make and specify the simulation target:

```bash
make tt6581
make tt6581_player
make tt6581_bode
make svf
make spi
make mult
make envelope
make delta_sigma
```

A brief description of each testbench:

- *tt6581:* Produces a 10 second song (`.wav` file). Intended to demonstrate must of the TT6581's capabilities. Uses all three voices and the filter.

- *tt6581_player:* This testbench simulates and players the entirety of _Monty on the Run_ by Rob Hubbard by reading the stimulus file `stimulus/Hubbard_Rob_Monty_on_the_Run_tt6581_stimulus.txt`. The stimulus was generated by running the assembly code for _Monty on the Run_ (from [this](https://github.com/realdmx/c64_6581_sid_players) repository) in a modified 6502 emulator that records all memory writes to the SID. The recorded memory writes where then translated to work on the TT6581.

- *tt6581_bode*: Simply plays a sine sweep and records the output. Produces a bode plot. Intended to check the frequency range.

- *svf:* Tests the Chamberlin SVF in all four supported modes. A sine sweep is used as the input. Produces four frequency response plots as the output.

- *mult*: Tests the 24x16 shift-add multiplier. Inputs N randomly generate operands and verifies the hardware result against software.

- *envelope:* Tests the envelope generator by inputting known ADSR values with a constant wave input. Plots the produced envelope.
